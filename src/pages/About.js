            I am Robert Guzman, an aspiring Software Engineer with a diverse
            skill set encompassing both front-end and back-end technologies. I
            am poised to graduate soon with a degree in Computer Science from
            Lehman College.

              Beyond my professional endeavors, I am deeply passionate about two
              main aspects of my life. First and foremost is my love for
              baseballâ€”a sport that has been a part of my identity since I was
              young. I find immense joy and camaraderie in the game, both as a
              player and a devoted fan. Additionally, my fascination with
              technology has been a driving force in my personal growth. From an
              early age, I immersed myself in the world of computers and
              programming. This interest led me to pursue a career in Software
              Engineering, where I blend my passion for technology with the
              excitement of creating innovative solutions. Born in the Dominican
              Republic, I brought the rich tapestry of my culture to New York at
              a young age. This unique blend of experiences has shaped my
              perspective and instilled in me a strong work ethic and
              resilience.

              One of my primary goals is to contribute meaningfully to the field
              of software engineering by developing innovative solutions that
              address real-world challenges. I aim to continuously enhance my
              skills and stay abreast of emerging technologies to deliver
              high-quality and efficient software.
